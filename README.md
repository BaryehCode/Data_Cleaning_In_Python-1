# Data_Cleaning_In_Python-1

This Project is an introduction to data cleaning. It employs basic methods in Pythin to help clean data and present it in a form where it is ready for analysis. Some of the methods employed are
- Checking for and eliminating duplicates (This dataset did not have any duplicates)
- Converting the date column to a form where Pands can recognize it as a date column and thus use it in date related analysis
- Splitting up of columns
- Changing values in columns etc
-A lot could have been done to the data but this is just an introduction. The 'final destination' of data cleaning (for want of a better phrase) is dependednt on the type of analysis the user intends to do on the data.

The Original adta is <nash_housing_data.csv> and the cleaned data is <nash_housing_data_cleaned.csv>
I will do another Data Cleaning project where I employ more robust techniques such as Data blending, creation of calculated columns etc
